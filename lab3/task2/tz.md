Create a simple To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with all working actions:
Adding a new item via a text input and button
Marking as "done" using a checkbox (with visual strikethrough or style change)
Deleting an item with a delete button
Focus on: DOM manipulation (createElement, appendChild, removeChild), event listeners (click, change), and dynamic styling. The page should have a clean, usable layout.
